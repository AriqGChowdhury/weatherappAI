This is a Weather App built using Python and Flask that provides weather information for the next 5 days. 
The app uses the Llama model to summarize the forecast and displays the summarized weather data to the user. 
It includes a database that allows CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to store and manage weather data.
The app also allows you to export the weather data stored in the database to a JSON format for easy data handling and sharing.

- CRUD Operations: Allows you to add, view, update, and delete weather records from the database.
- Database Export: Ability to export the database content to a JSON file.
- Flask Backend: Lightweight Python web framework to handle API requests and data processing.
- User Interface: Simple interface to interact with the weather data, see forecasts, and manage records.
